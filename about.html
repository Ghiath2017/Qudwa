          <h6>Tools for Data Science</h6>
          <p>
            What are some of the most popular data science tools, how do you use
            them, and what are their features? In this course, you'll learn
            about Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE, Apache Zeppelin and Data
            Science Experience. You will learn about what each tool is used for,
            what programming languages they can execute, their features and
            limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Cognitive Class
            Labs, you will be able to test each tool and follow instructions to
            run simple code in Python, R or Scala. To end the course, you will
            create a final project with a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science
            Experience and demonstrate your proficiency preparing a notebook,
            writing Markdown, and sharing your work with your peers.

          <h6>What is Data Science?</h6>
          <p>
            The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been
            around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data
            to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately
            predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then,
            people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct
            field for the work they do. This field is data science. In this
            course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get
            an overview of what data science is today.
